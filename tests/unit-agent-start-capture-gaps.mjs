/**
 * Gaps the agent_start capture does NOT close, pinned so the boundary is explicit.
 *
 * The agent_start record keys the prompt pi renders from the final before_agent_start
 * options (ctx.getSystemPrompt()), carrying the stashed portable parts. That fixes the
 * widened-dispatch case (see unit-agent-start-capture.mjs). The reported failure shapes
 * that still fall outside it:
 *
 * 1. Tail-stripped inheritance (issue #88): a child embedding its parent prompt minus
 *    pi's per-session tail (skills catalogue, cwd footer) matches no full-prompt key, so
 *    nothing is projected for that child. The shape remains unsupported, but the
 *    sendability guard fails with its diagnostic instead of silently forwarding pi's
 *    harness. (gotgenes/pi-subagents strips the tail; elidickinson/pi-subagents embeds
 *    verbatim and is covered by the agent_start record.)
 * 2. A prompt composed entirely outside pi's before_agent_start pipeline (issue #102's
 *    pi-web-ui shape) is neither a rendered-options key, a handler-returned force
 *    (which agent_start does capture — see the force test below), nor an embedding.
 * 3. A prompt that changes AFTER turn_start (issue #91's remaining shape): turn_start
 *    re-keys every turn (first included), but a prompt rewritten between turn_start and
 *    the stream call — an extension context-event handler or a forced-prompt projection
 *    on newer pi — is seen by no boundary.
