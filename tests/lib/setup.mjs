/**
 * Unit-suite preload: redirect the bridge's debug log to a throwaway directory.
 *
 * src/index.ts resolves DEBUG_LOG_PATH into a module-level const at import time
 * (and mkdirs it when CLAUDE_BRIDGE_DEBUG=1), so the override has to be in place
 * before any test imports the module. Doing that per test file is easy to forget,
 * and forgetting is invisible: the suite still passes everywhere except on a
 * developer machine with CLAUDE_BRIDGE_DEBUG=1, where the tests instead append
 * fixture data to the real ~/.pi/agent/claude-bridge.log.
 *
 * Wiring this as `node --import ./tests/lib/setup.mjs` guarantees it runs first
 * in every test child process. tests/unit-debug-path.mjs asserts it took effect.
