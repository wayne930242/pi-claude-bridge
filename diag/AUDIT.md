# Silent-loss audit

Scanners for the two boundaries where the bridge can lose or corrupt data without
anything throwing:

1. **Write path** — pi history → `convertPiMessages` → `repairToolPairing` →
   `Session.importMessages` → JSONL → `--resume`.
2. **Tool loop** — pi tools served over in-process MCP, `tool_use` blocks streamed
   back into pi, results paired by `_meta["claudecode/toolUseId"]`.

Both bugs found in July 2026 failed silently — nothing threw, no test went red,
and the only evidence sat on disk. These scripts make that evidence greppable.

```
node --import tsx diag/audit-transcripts.mjs [file.jsonl | projects-dir] [--since YYYY-MM-DD]
node --import tsx diag/audit-cache.mjs       [claude-bridge.log] [--since YYYY-MM-DD] [--ceiling 0.30]
node --import tsx diag/audit-warnings.mjs    [claude-bridge.log] [--since YYYY-MM-DD]
node --import tsx diag/replay-write-path.mjs <pi-session.jsonl>
```

Defaults are `~/.claude/projects` and the bridge log in pi's agent dir (`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, default `~/.pi/agent`).

**`--since` is what makes these gates rather than reports.** Everything found is
always printed, but the exit code counts only records and log lines inside the
window. Most of what is on disk is damage from bugs already fixed, and correctness
today will never remove it — without a window the check is red forever and stops
being read. Pass the date of the last known-good run to ask "has anything gone
wrong since?". One caveat: a rebuild re-stamps old messages with the time it ran,
so a session rebuilt inside the window drags its whole history in with it.

`--ceiling` exists because boundary cache breaks are an open finding rather than a regression; set it just above the latest measured rate to catch an increase while the cause is unresolved.

Dated baselines below cover the window named with each. Compare a future run against the baseline nearest it, not against zero.

## Anchoring — read this before changing any log scan

Tool output is echoed into `claude-bridge.log` verbatim. A bare `grep WARNING:`
or `grep '[no tool result recorded]'` matches compiler output, other tools' logs,
and any file an agent happened to read. Every scan here anchors on the bridge's
own line prefix `^\[<iso-ts>\] \[<module-id>\] `, and the transcript scanner only
substring-matches markers inside bodies under 200 chars.

How much this matters: raw `grep -c` over the transcripts reports 900
`[no tool result recorded]`, 126 `[image]`, 95 `[empty]`, 26 `[document]`,
13 `[thinking]`, 13 `[orphaned tool result removed]`. The structured count is
**799** and **zero** for all the others. Five of those six numbers are pure echo.

---

## `audit-transcripts.mjs`

Walks `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`, classifies each record, and reports loss
markers and structural defects. Takes a single file to investigate one session.

**Bridge-written vs CC-authored.** Bridge records carry `message.id` =
`msg_syn_*` and `requestId` = `req_syn_*`, minted by cc-session-io
(`syntheticMessageId`/`syntheticRequestId`). CC's are real `msg_01*`/`req_*`, with
`promptId` on user records and populated `usage` cache fields. High confidence.
A file usually contains **both** — the bridge writes the prefix at a rebuild, then
CC appends its live turns to the same file (352 of 1,810 files are mixed).

**Record regrouping is mandatory.** Claude Code stores *one content block per
record*: a single assistant message spans several `assistant` records sharing one
`message.id`, and each `tool_result` gets its own `user` record. cc-session-io
writes one record per message. A scanner that does not regroup by `message.id`
first reports hundreds of phantom defects on CC's own files — the first pass of
this audit reported 538 unpaired `tool_use`, 536 orphan `tool_result` and 432
split result records that all vanished after regrouping.

> **CC splits a turn's tool results across records** — 365 times in real
> transcripts, all CC-authored. Example:
> `~/.claude/projects/-Users-esd-Obsidian-eli-note-helper/93bcaf3e-f74c-4ca3-9328-b25f66619e60.jsonl`

### Baseline (2026-07-29)

```
scanned: 1810   cc-authored 854 | bridge-written 564 | mixed 352 | no-assistant 40

REAL PROJECTS
  [no tool result recorded]        407
  [incompatible content omitted]   125
  tool_use unanswered at EOF        30
  bridge-written non-MCP tool name  20
  tool_use with no tool_result       5
  tool_result after next turn        5
```

### What a clean run looks like

Zero markers and zero defects in real projects. It will not be clean today; the
baseline above is the known state. What matters is a **new** defect kind, or any
of the counts growing.

### Known-benign patterns

- **`[no tool result recorded]` × 407** — the parallel-results bug (fixed in
  ff60313c). 389 of 406 non-subagent occurrences sit in a record that *also*
  holds a real result from the same turn, which is the fingerprint of results
  2..N being dropped. Only 17 are genuine never-answered calls (lone stub, single
  `tool_use` in the turn). Should stop growing; existing files are historical.
- **`[incompatible content omitted]` × 125** — not lost content. Replaying all
  1,455 pi sessions through `convertPiMessages` shows ~75% replace assistant
  messages that were **already empty in pi** (606 such messages corpus-wide:
  325 `aborted`, 232 `error`, 49 `stop`), and the rest are thinking-only messages
  from *other* providers whose signatures we correctly refuse to replay
  (openai-codex 31, stepfun 24, cerebras 13, …). 72 pi sessions mix
  `claude-bridge` with another provider.
- **`tool_use` unanswered at EOF × 30** — all CC-authored tails, cut off by an
  abort or process exit. The bridge rotates the session on abort and never
  resumes them.
- **bridge-written non-MCP tool name × 20** — all `Read {"path":"token0.txt"}`
  unit-test fixtures. The same defect fires 5,525 times in test/temp dirs; that is
  not benign and has its own section below.
- **`tool_use with no tool_result` / `tool_result after next turn` × 5 each** —
  all inside CC's own `subagents/*.jsonl` sidechains, which interleave records
  across concurrent subagents. CC-authored, not ours.

### Checked and clean

`[empty]`, `[image]`, `[document]`, `[thinking]`, `[orphaned tool result removed]`
— zero real occurrences. Duplicate `tool_use` ids, orphan `tool_result`, empty
assistant records, transcripts starting mid-turn — zero in real projects. Image
fidelity holds: 104 images survive inside `tool_result` content and 4 as
top-level user blocks; none was flattened to `[image]` text.

## The benchmark harness manufactures the phantom-tool-call condition

Not a production defect, but it compromises the tool we would use to *test* for
one. Worth knowing before trusting a benchmark result.

`audit-transcripts.mjs` reports **5,525** bridge-written `tool_use` blocks with a
non-MCP name in test/temp dirs, across 469 files — `McpCustomToolsBash` ×3843,
`McpCustomToolsAgent` ×330, `McpCustomToolsGrep` ×314, `McpCustomToolsRead` ×311,
`Bash` ×176, `McpCustomToolsEdit` ×170, `McpCustomToolsWrite` ×137, plus bare
`Read`/`Edit`/`Write`. In those same dirs only **6** tool_use blocks carry a
correct `mcp__*` name.

Cause: the replay harness calls the conversion without a populated
`customToolNameToSdk` map, so `mapPiToolNameToSdk` (`src/convert.ts:43`) falls
through — to `PI_TO_SDK_TOOL_NAME`, turning pi's `bash` into Claude Code's builtin
`Bash`, or to `pascalCase` for anything else. The `McpCustomTools*` names in the
corpus came from that same map-less call handed an *already-prefixed* name, which
now throws (c31560bd); the builtin-name and `pascalCase` halves are unchanged, so
a map-less replay still manufactures the condition.

Why it matters: the provider path runs with `tools: []`, so a rebuilt transcript
claiming Claude previously called `Bash` is telling the model that a builtin it
cannot call is available and was used. That is precisely the prompt condition that
induced the bare-builtin `tool_use` blocks behind the phantom-call deadlock fixed
in 122914dd. **A benchmark replay can therefore reproduce that bug for reasons
that have nothing to do with the code under test, and can equally mask a real
regression by making the mangled state look normal.**

Production is unaffected, verified rather than assumed: across 86,652 real pi
messages exactly **4** `toolCall.name` values begin with `mcp__`, all genuine
`mcp__context7__*` from an external server in one session. In real project dirs
the bridge wrote 3,991 `mcp__*` names against 18 non-MCP ones, and those 18 are
the `token0.txt` unit-test fixtures.

Fix shape: have the replay harness pass the recorded tool list through to
`convertPiMessages`, or make the `pascalCase` fallback throw when handed a name
that already starts with `mcp__` — it can only be a double-mapping.

---

## `audit-cache.mjs`

The Anthropic prompt cache is keyed on exact prompt-prefix bytes, so a request
reading back less cache than the previous one wrote means the prefix diverged.
Both known bugs were prefix-mutation bugs, making this the cheapest always-on
integrity signal available.

**Metric.** In a healthy continuation, `cacheRead[N] == cacheRead + cacheWrite
[N-1]` — what the previous request left in the cache. Its `in` is excluded: those
tokens were not cached, and a tool-heavy turn sends its whole result payload that
way (see the false-positive section below, which is how this was found). A break is a shortfall ≥ 2,000 tokens, matching
`MIN_CACHE_MISS_TOKENS` in Claude Code's own
`src/services/api/promptCacheBreakDetection.ts`.

**The control group is the point.** Within one `query()` call the bridge cannot
mutate the prefix — it only appends tool results — so the in-query rate is pure
server-side eviction. Comparing the `--resume` boundary rate against it separates
"Anthropic evicted us" from "we sent different bytes".

Two parsing traps, both of which produced wrong answers on the first pass:
- A turn emits several `usage:` lines as its output grows. Dedupe on
  (cacheRead, cacheWrite, model), and when collapsing, **keep the first record's
  preceding log lines** — replacing the object swaps in the lines that came
  *after* the request, which silently reclassifies query boundaries as in-query.
- Skip pairs where the current request's own `cachePct ≥ 95`. A large shortfall
  with a high hit rate means the prefix legitimately got *shorter* (a rebuild that
  dropped messages), which is a shrink, not a break.

### Baseline (2026-07-29, 7,543 requests)

```
in-query   40 / 6466 pairs   0.6%   3.2M tok    <- control
boundary  136 /  549 pairs  24.8%  12.9M tok    <- --resume boundaries
breaks on a rebuild boundary: 35
```

Classified out as benign: idle > 5 min (88), effort changed (30), model change
(29), compaction/new session (10), tool set changed (2).

### Baseline (2026-09-25, 17,917 requests)

`audit-cache.mjs` reports 130/15,033 in-query pairs (0.9%) and 310/1,360 `--resume` boundaries (22.8%), including 89 breaks on `path=rebuild`. Split by sync path over the same boundary denominator: 89/139 rebuild boundaries (64.0%), 216/1,121 reuse boundaries (19.3%), 5/100 without a captured path. Nearly all of it is CC 2.1.141 or earlier; bin by CC version before comparing it with later runs (see the rebuild finding below).

Three rates measure different things: the boundary rate over all `--resume` boundaries (22.8% here, 24.8% in the July baseline), the break rate conditional on sync path (64.0%/19.3%), and the rebuild-cause census below, a share of rebuilds by cause. None substitutes for another.

### Rebuild-cause census

Counts `syncResult: path=rebuild` lines in the anchored bridge log, grouped by module id and matched to the event lines emitted by `syncSharedSession`, `markRebuildForSession`, the abort handler, and `discardRewrittenQuery`. The 188 `first` paths are reported separately: they have no prior shared-session id.

| Window (UTC) | `first` paths | Existing-session rebuilds |
|---|---:|---|
| 2026-04-12 – 2026-05-03 04:11 | 26 | 15: 8 abort, 7 unmarked history gaps |
| 2026-05-03 04:11 – 2026-09-24 19:24 | 158 | 150: 118 abort, 6 compact, 26 unmarked history gaps |
| 2026-09-24 19:24 – 2026-09-25 23:59 | 4 | 1: compact |
| Total | 188 | 166: 126 abort, 7 compact, 33 unmarked history gaps |

Window boundaries are where `session_tree:` logging and the parked-query discard path entered the code, so the eras are not comparable without binning.

All 126 `rotated-post-abort` rebuilds have a preceding `provider: abort detected` line. The log contains no `provider: history rewritten under a parked query`, `session_tree:`, `steer never reached CC`, or foreign-session `sync:` lines — so no discard sample and no tree sample exist to classify.

**The `rotated-post-abort` label is not a cause field.** `discardRewrittenQuery` also sets `forceRotate`, and a `preserveSharedSession` rebuild can also skip preserving the id. The 126 count is sound for this window only because every one carries an explicit abort marker. Add a structured `cause=` field to `syncResult` — `abort`, `discarded-query`, `compact`, `tree`, `history-gap`, `api-error` — rather than inferring cause from the rotation label.

The seven compact rebuilds carry a `session_compact:` marker and cannot be served by suffix truncation. All 33 unmarked preserved rebuilds log positive `Case 4` missed-message counts: the CC file lacks current history that must be imported, though the log does not record what supplied it.

Truncation ceiling: **126/166 (75.9%)** from aborts, or at most **133/166 (80.1%)** if every pre-instrumentation history gap were an eligible single-turn tree cut. The fork guard's single-turn condition is not measurable from this log. Candidate ceiling, not demonstrated implementation success. Across all 354 rebuilds, `first` included, aborts are 126 (35.6%).

Validation: parser checked against session `2y1vp2`, where abort markers precede two `rotated-post-abort` rebuilds, and `kq2gaa`, where `session_compact:` precedes a preserved rebuild. Counts require anchored regexes — unanchored, `session_tree` matches three bash tool-output echoes containing source text; anchored, zero.

The 25 `first` paths with a preceding `provider: query error` cannot be folded into the 166 denominator: `session_start:new/resume/fork` also clears the shared session, so `first` mixes new sessions, starts, resumes, forks, and error recovery. The API-error contribution to a broader rebuild denominator is unknown.

### Finding: since CC 2.1.263, a rebuild re-caches the whole conversation

Rebuild boundaries by CC version. Pairs as in `audit-cache.mjs` (same module and model, previous request within 5 minutes), at least 20k tokens cached, CC version read from `cc_version=` in the CLI log each query's `cli-debug:` line names:

| CC | Rebuilds | Read back ≥95% | Under 50% |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 2.1.86 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 2.1.114 | 3 | 0 | 3 |
| 2.1.126 | 17 | 4 | 12 |
| 2.1.141 | 96 | 17 | 75 |

Cold reads sit at 4k–16k tokens, about tools plus system prompt. The warm ones are exact: an abort rebuild of 485 pi messages on 2026-08-13 read back all 280,803 cached tokens and wrote 52. What made the cold majority cold is not found; the empty-signature thinking drop (end of this file) touches 1.1% of blocks, too few.

Since 2.1.263 CC also writes context records a rebuild drops. Counted by `attachment.type` in `~/.claude/projects` session files — types only CC writes, so provenance is not in question. Live prompts are user records with a `promptId` and text content, excluding `isMeta` and `req_syn_*`.

| CC | Live prompts | `total_tokens_reminder` | `environment`, `model`, `session_context`, `date` |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| 2.1.141 | 258 | 0 | 0 |
| 2.1.263 | 241 | 378 | 0 |
| 2.1.267 | 813 | 1,140 | 0 |
| 2.1.280 | 446 | 842 | one of each per session file |

`diag/probe-rebuild-fidelity.mjs` on 2.1.280 (3 Haiku 4.5 runs, 2 Opus 5 runs): every forced rebuild read back exactly tools plus system prompt, diverging at `messages[0]`, where the rebuilt prompt lacks CC's context blocks. Reuse controls and mid-turn boundaries read back fully. CC's cache breakpoints are the end of the system prompt and the newest message, so the only cached prefixes are the system prompt and earlier requests' full prompts, and one early difference costs the whole conversation. Later differences, moot once the first one hits: `timeout: 120` that `mapToolArgs` adds to bash calls, and `tool_result.content` written as a string with a different key order.

Real 2.1.280 usage: none of its six rebuilds passes the 5-minute filter. One has no earlier request in its process, one follows a 193-minute gap, and one follows a compaction that shrank the history. The other three follow 14–18 minute gaps — within the cache lifetime, since all 9 reuses on 2.1.263+ after a 5–60 minute gap read back fully — and all three read back only the floor: 11,451, 11,451, and 14,224 of 74k–104k. They are `first` rebuilds after `session_shutdown` cleared the mirror of a session the user then returned to, with CC's session file still on disk. Reuse is unaffected: all 40 comparable reuse boundaries on 2.1.263+ read back fully.

Hand-checked against the raw log: the 2026-08-13 warm rebuild and the three 2.1.280 cold ones.

### Finding: ~25% of `--resume` boundaries re-send the whole conversation

The one finding here that neither known bug explains. Superseded in part: most of
these are system-prompt changes, not conversation re-sends — see "Git-status
transitions" below.

Confirmed independently of the pair math, by bucketing the first `usage:` line
after every `provider: fresh query … resume=<id>`:

```
n=782    >=95%: 57.2%    50-94%: 1.3%    <50%: 41.6%
```

The distribution is **bimodal**: either the resume hits almost fully or it misses
almost entirely. Idle time explains the tail but not the body:

```
gap <1min    n=340   bad 27.6%
gap 1-5min   n=210   bad 30.0%
gap 5-15min  n= 71   bad 43.7%
gap 15-60min n= 46   bad 78.3%
gap >1h      n= 30   bad 96.7%     <- TTL expiry, expected
```

**28.5% of resumes within 5 minutes of the previous request re-send everything**,
against a 0.6% in-query control — roughly 40× the floor. Model, tool count,
effort, `appendSys` and `strictMcp` are identical across the boundary in the worst
cases; verified on `f7116u` 2026-07-29T02:23–02:54, five consecutive
`fresh query model=claude-opus-5[1m] tools=11 resume=f969ad62 effort=xhigh`, each
returning `cachePct=2%`. Worst single event: 2026-07-29T02:54:25, 409,454 tokens
re-cached 150 s after the previous turn, `path=reuse` (the bridge did not rewrite
the session at all).

Localization: among the 169 sub-5-minute failures, 43% have `cacheRead` exactly
equal to that pi process's *first*-request `cacheRead` (commonly 6,599 tokens).
A further 39% cache nothing at all (`cacheRead=0`). Break rate is flat across
prefix sizes (<20k through >200k) and across models, so it is not a large-context
or model-specific effect.

**Corrected reading of that 43%.** It was first read as "the system+tools preamble
survives, so divergence begins at the first conversation message", which pointed
away from the system prompt. That is backwards. The prefix is ordered
`tools → system[0..2] → messages`, and the constant is the **tools** prefix alone,
so `cacheRead == constant` means the tool schemas survived and **the system prompt
changed**. The 39% `cacheRead=0` bucket is the one that does not implicate the
system prompt — it is a tool-set change or a total eviction.

Two independent confirmations. Clean starts (`resume=none msgs=1`, where there is
no conversation to read back) land on exactly the same constants — 6,599 / 7,314 /
7,315 / 7,336 at `tools=11`, 7,976 at `tools=15` — and the constant does not move
while the prompt grows from 145k to 445k tokens. And `diag/probe-git-cache.mjs`
reproduces the truncation live: on a bridge-shaped request a git-status change
drops `cacheRead` from 26,941 to 11,754, the tools prefix, rather than to zero.

#### Withdrawn: the correlation with CC's appended-record count

A table here split boundaries by the previous query's tool-call count and reported a
monotone dose-response, read as support for the re-serialization hypothesis. It was
computed with the metric's false-positive mode, which counted a request's uncached
`input` as if the next request had to read it back — inflating precisely the
tool-heavy boundaries it was being used to explain. Withdrawn; recompute from
scratch rather than adjusting the old figures, which are in git history.

The hypothesis itself is untouched and still worth testing: every bridge turn
crosses a `--resume` boundary, CC appends its own records during the previous query
(one per content block, one per tool result), and if that disk round-trip is not
byte-faithful the prefix diverges exactly where the conversation starts. Note that
its signature is `cacheRead == tools + system`, not the tools-only constant, which
belongs to the system prompt. Calibrating the tools prefix per module from its
commit-spanning breaks (24 modules, 268 boundaries), 83 breaks land exactly on it
and 15 land elsewhere, so re-serialization can account for at most ~15% of
residual boundary breaks.

**Thinking blocks are untested, not exonerated.** The obvious log-side proxy did not
exist when this was written: `reasoning=` appears in **0** of 14,994 `usage:` lines.
The cause was a bridge defect, not a missing SDK field. `updateUsage` read
`usage.reasoning_tokens` (absent from every version of `@anthropic-ai/sdk`) and a flat
`usage.thinking_tokens`, but the count is nested at
`usage.output_tokens_details.thinking_tokens` — so every value CC sent was dropped, and
the recorded fixtures under `tests/fixtures/sdk-streams/` turned out to carry populated
counts all along. Fixed in `src/usage.ts`, so `reasoning=` now appears on turns that
think and this proxy is available for a *fresh* run. Every `usage:` line counted above
predates the fix; do not reread that window for it. The transcript-join fallback
(match the 8-char `resume=` prefix to a surviving `.jsonl`, then look at
CC-authored records inside the previous
query's time window) only lands 20 of 263 boundaries — most sessions have since
been deleted and rewritten by a rebuild — and the cells are n=1–2. Underpowered;
do not read a result into it. Images are likewise untestable here: zero boundaries
in the window had an image in the prompt.

#### Cheapest next step

**The `cache-break-*.diff` route is not available on the installed SDK.**
`promptCacheBreakDetection.ts` exists in `reference-code/claude-code-rip/`, but
that fork is newer than what we run: the string `PROMPT CACHE BREAK` does not
appear anywhere in `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` 0.2.141 / Claude Code 2.1.141,
and no `cache-break-*.diff` has ever been written on this machine. So there is no
gate to flip today.

Worth knowing for when the SDK is next bumped, because it then costs nothing: the
detector is wired into the ordinary API path (`services/api/claude.ts:1471`
`recordPromptState`, `:2384` `checkResponseForCacheBreak`), and the reason string
is emitted by a plain `logForDebugging(summary, { level: 'warn' })` gated only on
`isDebugMode()` — which the bridge already sets for every query via
`makeCliDebugOptions` (`src/index.ts:71`). It would land straight in
`~/.pi/agent/cc-cli-logs/*.log` as:

```
[PROMPT CACHE BREAK] <reason> [source=…, call #N, cache read: X → Y, creation: Z…]
```

with `<reason>` already naming the culprit ("system prompt changed (+N chars)",
"tools changed (+a/-b tools)", "effort changed", "possible 5min TTL expiry
(prompt unchanged)", "likely server-side (prompt unchanged, <5min gap)"). The
literal diff file is strictly more expensive — it additionally requires
`changes.buildPrevDiffableContent`, set only when a previous snapshot exists — so
grep the reason string first and only chase the diff if it is ambiguous.

**The request-body capture is built and works** — see `diag/capture-proxy.mjs` for
invocation and for how the capture dir must be handled. Subscription OAuth forwards
through a custom base URL, so no API key is needed; that caveat is settled.

### The metric had a false-positive mode; fixed, and the corpus number survives

An earlier version of this section claimed the finding reproduced in stock CC at
23%. It did not — that was the metric. The old expectation was
`cacheRead[N] == in + cacheRead + cacheWrite [N-1]`, and `in` is exactly the
tokens the API did *not* cache on that request. A turn that just ran tools sends
its whole result payload as uncached `in` (measured: `in=9409, cacheRead=45035,
cacheWrite=2327` on a 10-parallel-read turn), and the next request reads back
45035+2327 and writes the 9409. Nothing was lost; the old formula scored it as a
9,409-token break, and did so most often on precisely the tool-heavy turns whose
dose-response it was being used to explain.

Both scanners now expect `cacheRead + cacheWrite [N-1]` — what the previous
request demonstrably left cached. On the April–July corpus this changes almost
nothing (24.5% → 24.8% of boundaries, 12.3M → 12.9M tokens) because real breaks
collapse `cacheRead` to 2–13% of the prompt, far past one turn's `in`. **So the
corpus finding is not an artifact — but it also has not been reproduced.**

### The controlled runs do not reproduce it

33 bridge-free boundaries (`claude -p … --resume`, CC's own session file and tools,
one process per turn) at 45–85k prompts on Haiku: **0 cold** under the corrected
metric. Reads land within 10 tokens of expectation every time.

A second control, this time *through* the bridge: 15 `int-cache.sh` runs under the
capture proxy, **0 of 90 boundaries cold**. Each run is 5 prompts over ~13k prompt
tokens on Haiku with 2 tool calls, and every boundary reads back `cacheRead +
cacheWrite` to within ~70 tokens. Runs 2–15 also open fully warm (12283 read / 0
write) off run 1's prefix, so a resume attaching to an earlier *conversation's*
cache entry is not sufficient to break it either.

The audited failures are `claude-opus-5[1m]` at `xhigh` with 100–400k prompts and
total collapse — a regime neither control approaches — so leave
`diag/capture-proxy.mjs` on during a real session of that shape rather than paying
to synthesize one.

One cold boundary was observed outside the proxy and has not recurred: `int-cache.sh`
as stage 4 of `npm test`, turn 7 reading 0 and writing 13042 at a reuse boundary.
What distinguishes it from all 16 clean runs is turn 1's attach — 8309 read / 3976
write, a *partial* attach to the prefix left by the smoke and multi-turn stages,
against 12283 read / 0 write when the run is looped against itself. Looping
`int-cache.sh` alone cannot recreate that state; the chain has to run.

Note when reading a cold capture: `system[0]` carries CC's per-request billing
header (`cch=<hash>`), which changes every request, so `diff-captures.mjs` reports a
divergence at element 0 on **every** boundary, warm or cold. It is cacheable and
benign. Look past it to the first divergence that matters.

### Confirmed instead: CC's resume reorders same-millisecond tool_results

Ten sessions, each a single turn of 10 parallel `Read` calls followed by a resume,
comparing the resumed request's block order against the session file on disk:

```
8 of 10 resumes reordered a parallel tool_result group
in all 8, every swapped pair shared a millisecond timestamp
the live request's order matched disk order in 10 of 10
```

Always adjacent-pair swaps, never a shuffle. So the write is faithful and the read
is not: reconstructing a conversation from the JSONL does not preserve the relative
order of `tool_result` records that share a timestamp. Two sessions with tied pairs
came back unchanged, so a tie permits the divergence rather than forcing it.

**It is deterministic per session file, not a race.** Resuming the same session
three times reproduced byte-identical order every time — the reordered session
reordered the same two pairs on all three resumes, the unchanged one stayed
unchanged. The cost is therefore one cache write, not a recurring tax: the first
resume wrote 57,014 tokens and the next two read them straight back (`write=45`).

This is a genuine fidelity bug in Claude Code and it is filable — it reproduces on
demand at ~80% with ten parallel reads. It is also rare in practice, because the
repro manufactures the tie: across 1,548 pre-existing session files only 2 of 417
CC-authored parallel groups contain a same-millisecond pair (0.5%), since real
batches are 2–3 calls (406 of 417) whose results land milliseconds apart. Bridge-
written records cannot tie at all — cc-session-io stores a turn's results in one
record with one timestamp — so only CC's live-appended groups are exposed.
Measured: the order is stable across repeated resumes, so no repeated invalidation. What it is *not* is an explanation of the
cold resumes: the reordered blocks sit in the not-yet-cached tail, and the ten
sessions show no cache shortfall at all. An earlier version of this section claimed
the transposition was "sufficient on its own to produce a cold resume"; the two
unchanged-order sessions had the same cache profile as the eight reordered ones,
so that claim was wrong.

Two facts the capture settles regardless:

- **CC's per-request billing header is not what breaks the cache.** `system[0]` is
  `x-anthropic-billing-header: … cch=<hash>`, carries no `cache_control`, and
  changes on every single request — yet req-0006 read back exactly the 12,205
  tokens req-0004 had written under a different `cch=`. The cached prefix begins
  after it.
- **CC asks for a 1-hour cache TTL**, not five minutes: both cacheable system
  blocks carry `cache_control: {type: "ephemeral", ttl: "1h"}` on
  `/v1/messages?beta=true`. That reinterprets the gap table above — under a 1h TTL
  the `>1h` row (96.7% cold) is simply expiry, but `15-60min` at 78.3% is not, so
  either the TTL request is newer than the April–July log window or something else
  evicts well inside it.

Cost, meanwhile, is real: 12.3M tokens re-cached in the classified-clean set alone.

#### If this is Claude Code's bug, it is not only ours

The correlation points at CC's own resume round-trip, not at anything the bridge
writes: the worst cases are `path=reuse` boundaries where the bridge did not touch
the session file at all, and the records implicated are the ones **CC itself**
appended during the previous query. If that holds, every SDK consumer that resumes
a session pays the same tax, and it belongs upstream rather than in this repo.

Evidence needed to make that case, and where it now stands:

1. **A request-body diff — the tooling exists and works** (`capture-proxy.mjs` +
   `diff-captures.mjs`), but it has never yet been pointed at a request that
   actually broke. 33 controlled boundaries produced no break to diff.
2. **Reproduced on a CC-authored session file — not achieved.** The scripted runs
   are bridge-free as intended, but they never went cold, so they neither
   implicate nor exonerate CC for this finding. Still open.
3. **The dose-response — now suspect.** It was computed with the metric whose
   false-positive mode scales with tool-result size, which is the same thing the
   table's x-axis measures. Recompute it against the corrected expectation before
   relying on it.

The one upstream report that *is* ready is unrelated to caching: the reordering of
same-millisecond parallel `tool_result` blocks on resume.

### Finding: git-status transitions change the system prompt and truncate the read

CC's `claude_code` preset ends with a `gitStatus:` block (`git status --short`
plus `git log --oneline -n 5`) inside `system[2]`, which carries `cache_control
ephemeral 1h`. Native CC computes it once per process; the bridge re-invokes CC
per turn, so it is recomputed every turn and tracks the current working tree.

`diag/probe-git-cache.mjs` pins the mechanism live against CC 2.1.141 / SDK
0.2.141. Editing a file already listed dirty leaves `system[2]` byte-identical and
hits fully; a status *transition* diverges inside the git block and truncates the
read to the tools prefix. Confirmed for a new untracked path, `git add`
(`' M'` → `'M '`), and a new commit. `system[0]` carries a per-request
`x-anthropic-billing-header` with no `cache_control` and is ignored by the cache
key — exclude it when diffing, or every pair looks divergent.

#### Rate and cost

Denominator is `--resume` boundary pairs after the standard exclusions (idle >5
min, model change, effort change, tool-set change, compaction/reset, clean start,
rebuild):

```
boundary pairs (strict)              1025
system-prompt breaks                  173    16.9%
in-query control (same rule)     43/12844     0.3%   <- system prompt is fixed for a query's lifetime
```

173 breaks re-cached **25.6M tokens** over 2026-04-09 → 2026-08-24; median 118k
per event, p90 330k, max 516k. On the 631 boundaries where the working directory
is recoverable the rate is 24.2%.

#### The commit-spanning test

Commits are the one transition with an independently recorded timestamp, so they
can be joined against the log. A boundary "spans a commit" when the previous
query's window contains a commit in that session's repo:

```
             sys-break   clean
spans commit      52       14     78.8%
no commit        101      464     17.9%
odds ratio 17.1     Fisher two-tailed p = 2.5e-23
```

Controls: a placebo window shifted −24 h gives OR 2.9, so activity clustering is
real but an order of magnitude smaller. The effect holds in every previous-query
duration bin (`<60s` 50% vs 3.4% through `>10m` 85.7% vs 46.7%) and every prefix
size bin (`<50k` 44% vs 9% through `>250k` 91% vs 25%). Single-repo natural
experiment, one pi process `ya6eny` on 2026-08-12: 16 of 18 commit-spanning
boundaries dropped to exactly 7,976, 0 of 54 non-spanning ones did, and every
non-spanning boundary read 98–100%.

Attributable to commits alone (excess over the non-spanning baseline): 40 events,
**8.7M tokens**. A floor, since `git add`, new untracked files and branch switches
are equally fatal and leave no recoverable timestamp.

#### Caveats

- **Whether this predates July 2026 is undetermined.** Monthly rate: Apr 6.4%
  (n=157), May 10.4% (48), Jun 6.5% (46), Jul 24.3% (259), Aug 17.9% (515). Only
  2 commit-spanning boundaries with a resolved repo exist before July, so the jump
  could be a CC version change, a usage-pattern change, or improving cwd coverage.
- `500eea19` does **not** split the corpus; it changed the AskClaude path only.
  The provider path has passed `preset: "claude_code"` since 2026-04-02, before
  the log opens (`git log -S`).
- The non-commit portion is not decomposable: the 15.4% non-spanning on-prefix
  break rate mixes untracked files, staging, branch switches, date rollover,
  CLAUDE.md edits, and commits the scan missed. The commit test isolates git for
  at least 26% of system-prompt breaks; the rest is unattributed.
- cwd is unrecoverable for 38% of boundaries (394/1025), mostly early sessions
  that never logged a rebuild.
- `git log --all` may count commits on non-HEAD branches or rebase-rewritten
  dates as spanning, which biases toward the null — the true effect is if
  anything stronger.

## `audit-warnings.mjs`

Inventories `WARNING:`/`BUG:` lines with counts and date spans, plus two tool-loop
invariants that have no WARNING of their own.

### Baseline (2026-07-29, 84,115 anchored lines, 1,929 pi processes)

```
   3  2026-04-10..2026-07-29   WARNING: N MCP handlers still waiting after delivering N results
   2  2026-04-12               WARNING session verify: forced test failure   (from tests/)
   1  2026-05-04               WARNING: mcp handler bash has no toolCallId
   1  2026-07-29               BUG: both maps non-empty! handlers=1 results=1

MCP handlers that waited and were never resolved: 32  (28 after abort/shutdown, 4 unexplained)
tool results queued for a handler that never claimed them: 14  (7 after abort/shutdown, 7 unexplained)
```

### Known-benign / explained

- **`mcp handler … has no toolCallId`** (1, 2026-05-04) predates `fc2efeb6`,
  which switched pairing to `_meta["claudecode/toolUseId"]`. None since.
- **`session verify: forced test failure`** (2) is `tests/` doing its job.
- **`BUG: both maps non-empty!`** (1, 2026-07-29T15:33:17.805Z, module `ere6hm`)
  is the phantom-tool bug caught live: the queued id
  `toolu_01JzMLYBmz7yEx9R9Zc4AvdB` appears in
  `~/.pi/agent/cc-cli-logs/2026-07-29T15-27-41-863Z-provider-3.log` as
  `Unknown tool bash`. The turn hung 27 minutes until the user aborted. Fixed in
  122914dd.
- **28 of 32 stranded handlers** are followed by `wasAborted=true`,
  `abort detected`, or `session_shutdown` — pi tore the turn down before
  delivering, which is expected. The remaining 4 are pi processes whose last log
  line *ever* is the `waiting`; for each, the matching cc-cli log ends with
  `LSP server manager shut down successfully` within 0.3–3.2 s, i.e. the pi
  process exited mid-dispatch. Corroborated CC-side: only 5 `tool_dispatch_start`
  events across 1,135 logs lack a matching `tool_dispatch_end`.
- **10 of the 14 orphan queued results** match an `Unknown tool <name>` id in the
  corresponding cc-cli log — the phantom-tool bug's other half.

### Checked and clean

`WARNING: currentPiStream overwritten before terminal event` — 0 occurrences.
`WARNING: steer with no prompt stream, dropping` — 0. `extractAllToolResults`
returning 0 while a handler waits — 0 (10 zero-result calls, all on a
single-message or genuinely empty context). Results-vs-handlers accounting: 5,350
exact matches, 1,033 results-ahead-of-handler (normal, they park in
`pendingResults`), 2 handlers-ahead-of-results (both are the logged WARNINGs).

## Not covered by these scripts

One incident class lives in the cc-cli logs and has no scanner yet.

**Orphaned Claude Code subprocess — trigger unknown.** A CC child outlived its pi
session and kept working: every MCP call failed instantly with `Stream closed`
(the transport was gone), CC treated that as a normal tool error, fed it to the
model, and issued another API request — for the better part of an hour.

| # | cc-cli log | onset | end | `Stream closed` | API requests | stopped by |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | `2026-07-10T22-48-21-609Z-provider-1.log:474` | 23:08:21 | 00:07:30 | 1,396 | 1,416 | LSP shutdown, 59 min |
| B | `2026-06-03T20-19-06-231Z-provider-1.log:422` | 20:24:12 | 20:42:08 | 356 | 375 | **429 rate_limit_error**, 23 min |

All failures are `after 0s`. Incident B consumed enough quota to trip the account
rate limit, which would have hit the user's other sessions. Bridge-side, both
processes' last log line precedes the storm (`claude-bridge.log:48337` for A,
`:29487` for B).

**"After the pi process dies" was this section's first guess and it is wrong.**
`tests/int-shutdown-kills-cc.mjs` drives both reachable triggers against the
installed CC/SDK and the child dies within a second either way: pi exiting closes
the child's stdin, which CC treats as EOF even with a tool call parked, and a user
abort fails the prompt stream and then interrupts and closes the query. So both
incidents needed a third condition that leaves pi *alive* with its control channel
closed — the child is only unreapable while the pi process still holds it.

What the timeline does say, for incident A: pi logged `mcp handler: bash
[toolu_01MVF…] → waiting` at 23:08:17.766 and never logged again, and CC failed
that same dispatch `outcome=error durationMs=1215` 1.2 s later, then re-issued the
call under a fresh id. CC's log runs continuously for the next 59 minutes with no
timestamp gap, so the machine was awake and pi was not merely suspended. Both
incidents predate the July 2026 tool-loop fixes (122914dd, 7ff04fd2, 549bab95,
da8513b5), there are exactly two in 1,159 cc-cli logs, none since 2026-07-10, and
the distribution is binary — no log has between 1 and 5 `Stream closed` failures.
That is consistent with an already-fixed cause, which is why nothing is being
built for it; the two tests are the tripwire if it returns.

Also unscanned: **thinking blocks dropped for want of a signature**.
`src/index.ts:1056` stores `thinkingSignature: block.signature ?? ""` and
`src/convert.ts:135` requires a truthy signature to replay. Across all pi
sessions, 26 of 2,363 `claude-bridge` thinking blocks (1.1%, 59,785 chars) have an
empty signature and are dropped from every rebuild — largest single loss 6,013
chars. The drop is correct behaviour (Anthropic rejects unverifiable signatures);
what is unexplained is why the SDK omits the signature. A WARNING at the
`?? ""` site would make the rate visible.
